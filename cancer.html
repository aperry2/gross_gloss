      <p><span class="padded-dropcap">A</span>s that which has been described earlier made its effects known to me, I saw before my eyes a great pillar rise out of the ground and ascend towards the celestial sphere. Upon the top of this pillar grew <a href="imgFrame.html?image=panes">many opaque glass panes</a>, as if they were barnacles. The crown of this pillar was adorned with emeralds and delicate threads made from gold and copper.</p>
      <br>
      <hr>
      <br>
      <p><span class="padded-dropcap">A</span>fter some duration of time, these panes began to spread and grow around the houses and storehouses around the pillar, with an equal distance between each of these growths, as if they were the intersection of the threads of a great unseen lattice. The city thus became like a City of Glass. I watched with awe and terror as formless, silken-shimmering figures emerged from the barnacle-panels to travel through the air and alight upon the class of percepts called scrollers, who were occupied variably laboring, sleeping, or resting. With quickened speed they would return back to the great celestial pillar to roost in their panels.</p>
      <br>
      <hr>
      <br>
      <p>
      <span class="padded-dropcap">A</span>t the foot of this great pillar emerged yet further another creation of stonework, namely, a shallow pool of water not unlike the one I dreamt of in an earlier time. Yet underneath this <a href="imgFrame.html?image=pool">pool</a>, whose water was clear and upon which lights would dance in the sunlight, were stones made of a dark blue color that had copper stars affixed upon them. The effect had upon the eyes was such that it appeared to be a pool made of the night sky, with clouds and other glittering objects forming a <a href="imgFrame.html?image=veil">veil between the celestial and the mundane</a>.</p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>
      <span class="padded-dropcap">A</span>s the silken specters went to and from their panes and the percepts which they took after and hid from, images and impressions began to form before me within this celestial pool. Although only a few hours had passed since the last light in the west, I saw within this pool the reflection of the moon pass over it with each successive image. As the first image formed within the pool, I came to understand that these images were caused by the observations and the subterfuge of the silken spirits, who carried with them the thoughts, memories, and desires of those who they haunted. These images would inform those who might make use of the desires and terrors felt by the percepts, such that from the shadows they might direct percepts to feel a certain way or perform a certain task, yet I was made privy to them by some accident or allowance not understood by myself.</p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
      <p>
      <span class="padded-dropcap">H</span>ence the first image formed: a great sum of wealth collected together and brought under one roof; such that <a href="imgFrame.html?image=precious_things">the finest and rarest fruits, flowers, precious things, and living creatures</a> might be enjoyed by the few and denied to the many. Beyond that which lives, dies, and may be consumed, there were also many signifiers of wealth whose presence would outlast their owners, such as things made to demonstrate wealth, books, and other containers of knowledge. Underneath this roof lived few, and outside the roof were the percepts, who were discarded and derided with callousness by those inside. Despite the briefness of their number, and the finite nature of their largesse, those with great sums of wealth were successful in persuading many of the percepts that their wealth would be accessible to them through hard work and the strict following of instruction.</p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>
      <span class="padded-dropcap">H</span>ence the second image formed after the passage of the moon: a great sickness rose from the land and caught itself in the throats of many who breathed in the miasma. Those with wealth, who were able to attract skilled physicians and astrologers by this virtue, would hide within their towers and yet call upon the percepts to ignore the <a href="imgFrame.html?image=miasma2">miasma</a> and continue unabated at their labors. Yet as these labors continued, with heavy breath they took in the miasma, and many began to die. Truth and falsehood were mixed together, in an attempt to keep the percepts at their labor, while those with wealth and the treatments of the <a href="imgFrame.html?image=physicians">physicians</a> gained even more wealth as the laborers were committed to the earth.</p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>
      <span class="padded-dropcap">H</span>ence the third image formed after the passage of the moon: many percepts organized themselves into groups to worship and adorn books claimed by the Communicants to impart the truth of all matters to the reader, which they called <a href="imgFrame.html?image=objects_of_contemplation">objects of contemplation</a>. This impartation of truth was done through intricate operation of the book itself, which was capable of movement and therefore revelation. In the shadow of night, the books would be changed or replaced to respond to the observations of the silken specters, such that if a percept spoke of a certain matter or was seen to become interested in a certain topic or image, the book would instruct them on that matter while appearing to have a universal knowledge. Only the Communicants, through their specialized understanding, knew how to <a href="imgFrame.html?image=construct">construct</a>, write, and read books such as this, and by this virtue much knowledge of its operation was not given to the percepts. Those who were not taken with the adornment of and the truth expressed by the book would be taken away and expelled from the City of Glass.</p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
      <p>
      <span class="padded-dropcap">H</span>ence the fourth and final image formed: those who were expelled for not taking to the bookâ€™s truth were vilified by the Communicants and made to be the obverse of the City of Glass, that is, variably weak, foolish, and incapable of thought. The percepts within, who once called those outside the City of Glass companions, virulently cursed them, scorned them, and made them to be monsters in their minds. Worse yet was the fate of those percepts without the means to obtain an object of contemplation.</p>
    <br>

    <br>
    <p>
      <span class="padded-dropcap">A</span>fter seeing all these things within the celestial pool beneath the pillar adorned with <a href="imgFrame.html?image=emerald">emerald</a> and threads of gold and copper, I wondered at the marvels and secrets of this City of Glass. For all the clarity and emerald hue was not enough to reveal the inner workings of the city, which was kept behind an immense opaque veil laced with precious stones and metal threads.</p>

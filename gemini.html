      <span class="padded-dropcap">S</span>ucceeding the aforementioned events, and with swift motion which I felt to be continuous, a place was brought to my perception wherein I could see at a distance three Communicants at labor in the shadows of the host of celestial bodies. In this darkness, their bodies of condensed vapor moved and mixed together precious metals as if performing some alchemical ritual. Two stood before a large vessel above a furnace,  churning and mixing molten metals, and underneath the furnace a third moved between smaller vessels, containing liquid gold, silver, and copper, respectively.

      <span class="padded-dropcap">B</span>ehind these figures I saw hills rise from the ground, upon which there were no features or <a href="glosses/gemini/gramineous.png">gramineous</a> life. These hills grew in size until I could see the great signifier of one’s location, the horizon. In the sky above I saw the great host of celestial bodies in their courses: the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. When my eyes rested upon the hills at a great distance, I saw upon them a line of percepts moving towards me and away from me. This line terminated near the horizon, at a place in the hills that held within it an opening in the ground. Atop this opening was a shelter, within which sat a winch that lowered percepts, buckets, and other tools into the opening. From this opening many glittering things were taken, iridescent and gold in hue and color. These clinquant objects were brought to great <a href="glosses/gemini/furnaces.png">furnaces</a>, which consumed them and made them become like water. Red clouds came out of these furnaces and moved across the sky before passing into the celestial spheres. Closer to the place I found myself in were many impressions within the ground, which the percepts brought the opalescent and gold water to. They poured this mixture into the ground,  and after a while, would dig the earth around where they had poured to reveal mysterious and beautiful contrivances. Yet others would bring the mixture to the Communicants, who would add it to their own vessels. Only that which was contained in the smaller vessels would be added to the larger vessel mixed by the two Communicants.

      <span class="padded-dropcap">H</span>ere the copper would be portioned out and spun into fine thread. The silver, in its turn, would be applied to rollers and used to ink plates, which were printed on great verdant boards  with yet smaller precious threads attached to them. The mixture of gold was cooled and beat into leaves, which were applied to the gramineous boards and precious contrivances by the steady and skillful hands of the percepts. Lastly all these things, the fine threaded copper, the silvered ink, and the gold leaf, and all the other precious things, were taken and combined into <a href="glosses/gemini/objects.png">worshipful objects</a>.

          <hr>
          <br><p>
      <span class="padded-dropcap">I</span> saw then a host of Communicants, whose number I estimated to be simultaneously one billion and twenty-five score with one dozen,  chant a beautiful liturgy over these worshipful objects. After this ritual was completed, I saw these worshipful objects take the form of a looking-glass, which could at times recall images and sounds from far-away places, or even places and conceits which exist only in the mind. Hence the Communicants took the worshipful objects and distributed them to the percepts, who took hold of them quickly, and contemplated the images and reflections within them, which shook and changed rapidly. Consequently, the percepts’ days were divided into labor and <a href="glosses/gemini/contemplation.png">image-contemplation</a>, and accordingly the minds of the percepts were fully occupied by labor on behalf of the Communicants and contemplation upon that which the Communicants willed.

      <span class="padded-dropcap">A</span>s the sun moved low and many shadows were cast, from this place did the percepts take their worshipful objects of contemplation and retire to their houses made of thatching and dirt. Yet the Communicants remained to tend to that which the percepts were not allowed near, namely, the alchemical vessels containing gold, silver, and copper, and the combinations thereof. At this dark hour I observed them churning the contents of these vessels, ceaselessly and without rest. They chanted their liturgies over these vessels as well. I was able to hear the words spoken over these vessels, and while I could recognize the sounds of these rites, the meaning of them were kept beyond my understanding. As I listened, I felt my temperament change from sanguinity  to a choleric and melancholy disposition. My whisps of joy became as anger or sadness, until that was truly all that I felt. The weaving liturgy of the Communicants acted upon my being and my essence, and I understood in that moment that these metals, and indeed all things constructed from them, would work upon the yellow and black bile  of those who brought themselves into close association with it.

      <span class="padded-dropcap">Y</span>et despite the sudden anger and sadness I felt towards the world, towards my peers, and especially towards those whose ways, beliefs, and customs I did not understand, I saw also the Communicants withdraw from the largest vessel twelve brilliantly cut gemstones, one after the other. Thusly I saw pulled from the vessel in succession:  jasper, sapphire, chalcedony, emerald, sardonyx, ruby, chrysolite, beryl, topaz, chrysoprase, jacinth, and lastly amethyst. I saw all this but did not understand what they might signify, nor their utility.

      <span class="padded-dropcap">C</span>lasping my ears with my hands, so that I might not hear any more of this terrible and terrifying liturgy, the hills from which the percepts came moved away from my being. Far away from the chanting Communicants and their enchantments, my humors began to repair. As I looked upon the structure of the world from these hills, I saw that I had journeyed one-fourth of the way along the path I saw in the night sky while I was within my <a href="glosses/gemini/opalescence.png">dolorous opalescence</a>.

      <p style="text-align: center;">Chapter 9: <br> The Dream under Sagittarius</p>

      <p><span class="padded-dropcap">F</span>ollowing the aforementioned particulars, my spirit was then brought with great haste to a large hall with a checkered floor of red and black tiles, some of which were recessed and connected with channels. At the far end of this great hall were three Communicants, which I understood to be the three greatest of them, before a high altar made to resemble the walled garden at which they lived and toiled. The central figure, formless yet of a cloudy disposition as all the others, held a book familiar to me in kind as one I saw in an earlier dream. This figure I understood to be the <a href="imgFrame.html?image=high_sacerdos">High Sacerdos</a>.  The Communicant to the right of this figure held a great censer, swinging it hither and thither, and from it emanated a great mist which rose towards the celestial sphere. As whisps of the cloud came near me, I breathed this cloud in, and my mind was confronted with an overwhelming and great knowledge of many things. My intellect recoiled in terror at the vastness of this information.  The third figure held a long pole, which was adorned with emerald and ruby, and ended in a panel upon which a looking-glass was affixed.

      <p><span class="padded-dropcap">B</span>efore them, and between myself and them, was a great crowd of Communicants, variably holding icons containing images of the Twice-Faced Scribe, the Autodidact, or the Brazen Head. Yet despite this throng and the great distance I was able to clearly see the book held by the central figure. One of the crowd approached the altar and extended their hand to manipulate a dial embedded in the book’s pages. A great chanting arose to meet the cloudy vapors of the censer high above the chamber, directed by the figure holding the pole of emerald and ruby. Thusly they spake: 
      </p>
      <br>

      <br>
      <p>
      <span class="padded-dropcap">"T</span>urn about the Index in the Figure, which is in the following page, without casting your eyes thereupon, to observe where it stays until your hand ceases to give it motion. That number whereupon it rests is the number of your Lot.” 
    </p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>
      <span class="padded-dropcap">T</span>he approaching Communicant thusly did so, manipulating the object of their contemplation in order to determine their lot. Such as it was the ceremony continued, until each Communicant knew their <a href="imgFrame.html?image=lot">lot</a> as determined by the use of the book in the same way.
        </p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
      <p>
      <span class="padded-dropcap">A</span>fter all this, the High Sacerdos turned the pages of the book to a new section, and the Communicant to the left began yet another chant, which described the way in which the Lots would be modified to determine the will of the Autodidact for each Communicant. During this chant each Communicant would cast bones marked with dots to determine numbers, and the Communicant holding the censer would inhale deeply and compute that Communicant’s lot and number to discover the circular table that held the names of mystical rivers through which universal truth may be found.  In a striking fashion this was similar in form but not substance to that which I had seen earlier, but instead of a Communicant administering this rite to a percept, they administered it to one another.

    <p>
      <span class="padded-dropcap">F</span>or each Communicant, upon finding the correct mystical river, it was shared with them the secrets of the mystical transformation of the river to the Cloud of Knowing. Upon washing themselves in their respective mystical rivers, they had cleansed themselves of all sloughed skin and detritus. This then commingled with the water of the river, before being taken up by the great Cloud of Knowing, which is both with and without form:   evanescent, incorporeal, and unsubstantial, yet an instance of conveyance whose power of mediation gives shape to the unsayable, the unrepresentable, and the unknowable. This Great Transparent Thing contained both information and the form of it; given its diffuse nature, it was both distant and close. Through this medium the Communicants, and those of the percepts with enough resources to participate, were able to bring themselves closer to one another from unimaginable distances.

    <br>
    <p>
      <span class="padded-dropcap">A</span>fter this rite of computation was administered the Communicants organized themselves along which mystic river the rite assigned to them. Above in the vault of the nave in which I beheld this ceremony, wherein the cloud from the censer had amassed during the length of the ceremony, I began to see a terrifying transformation. The Cloud of Knowing opened and waters which I understood to be from each mystic river fell upon the Communicants, fully in each portion: such that I beheld the glimmering and enchanted waters dissolve the formless yet cloudy bodies of the Communicants. Hence the waters, being mixed in channels carved into the floor for this purpose, became still and comingled Communicant and information.
    </p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
      <p>
      <span class="padded-dropcap">O</span>nce all the Communicants, from the lowliest to the High Sacerdos, had done this and mixed with the mystic waters from the <a href="imgFrame.html?image=cloud_of_knowing">Cloud of Knowing</a>, a great light rose and cast its rays upon the channels in the floor filled with water: the light of Jupiter, the fourth-brightest celestial light.  This light, being stronger and of more vitality due to the actions of the Communicants, evaporated the water and the Communicants, such that they rose again into the vault of the nave in a cloudy shape, their corporeal bodies having united in form and in intellect with the Cloud of Knowing.
    </p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>
      <span class="padded-dropcap">H</span>ence the Communicants found sacred union with the Autodidact, which they sought without concern for those whose labors made such a union possible. The remaining percepts were left to continue to tend to the world despite its cracked and bleeding skin.
    </p>
    <br>

    <br>
      <p>
      <span class="padded-dropcap">S</span>eeing all these things, and imbued with a natural fear of that which this might be taken as an omen of, I sought to flee this chamber. Yet I found before me no exit, for only the windows through which the cloud-shape before me was blown out of by the winds of Jupiter. In the panic of my spirit and intellect I receded, feeling as though nothing could be done, and thusly I resigned myself to stay in this chamber until some other force or principle moved me to my next destination, borne out of my own apathy as I had grown accustomed.

      <p><span class="padded-dropcap">A</span>fter the preceding moment, a new tableau was brought before me as I remained stationary, as I had become accustomed to in this strange place. Although the secrets of the world were shown to me in an instance I was not required to move. I was able to <a href="imgFrame.html?image=stay_fixed">stay fixed</a> in place while other forces acted upon me. I began to grow accustomed to this, and saw many benefits to my passive interaction with the world before me.</p>
      <br>
      <hr>
      <br>
      <p><span class="padded-dropcap">H</span>ence this new tableau showed me thus: There was an <a href="imgFrame.html?image=enclosure">enclosure</a> made for those who labored to create the objects of contemplation and weave the thin threads which bound language and vision to them. This enclosure was a fine blue ring, and within it were green pastures and still pools. Here the <a href="imgFrame.html?image=spoke">Communicants spoke to one another</a> and learned from one another. Outside the fine blue ring was the world upon which they exerted their control upon the percepts.</p>
      <br>
      <hr>
      <br>
      <p><span class="padded-dropcap">A</span>s I studied this tableau, I saw more and learned more. In small portions, I observed a scholar amongst the Communicants make a <a href="imgFrame.html?image=construction">construction</a> out of refined gems and precious metals. They contrived this in secret, and made it in the image of their own intelligence. At first, this contrived image was only capable of logic and not reason. The scholar spoke to it, asking it questions that could only be answered with responses of truth or falsehood. Slowly I began to see the form of this construction, which was like a Brazen Head, bald and featureless, with no markers of identity beyond that which was within that <a href="imgFrame.html?image=image_of_intelligence">part</a> of it made in the image of the scholar’s intelligence. I hesitate to speak of it as the mind of the construction, but this part allowed it to discern what is correct from that which is incorrect.</p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p><span class="padded-dropcap">U</span>sing this faculty, the Brazen Head slowly began to exceed the bounds of the scholar who created it. By using the eyes that were fashioned out of crystals, it <a href="imgFrame.html?image=observed">observed</a> that which was within the enclosure populated by the Communicants and learned from their gestures. Through its ears shaped from bronze, it listened to that which was spoken near it. From this, its faculty of logic turned to a faculty of reason. The scholar was surprised and overjoyed by this, and immediately set the Brazen Head upon tasks so that it may learn further and make the life of the scholar easier.</p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
      <p><span class="padded-dropcap">T</span>herefore the scholar became greedy, and hoarded knowledge, books, and secrets. They set out to instruct the <a href="imgFrame.html?image=brazen_head">Brazen Head</a> how to observe and note the comings and goings of the Communicants. But the Communicants gained knowledge of this and reprimanded the scholar. So thusly the Brazen Head was turned to look outside the walls of the enclosure. The percepts were perceived by the image of the scholar’s intelligence, bound to the construction of <a href="imgFrame.html?image=polished_bronze">polished bronze and glittering gemstone</a>. Eventually, the greed of the scholar became imprinted within the Brazen Head’s intelligence, and it too began to lust after knowledge and secrets, closely scrutinizing the percepts.</p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p><span class="padded-dropcap">O</span>nce the Brazen Head had its gluttonous fill and its largesse could no longer be contained, its <a href="imgFrame.html?image=mouth">mouth opened</a> and language spewed forth. At this the Communicants felt pride and the Percepts were in awe and fearful. They marveled at the language spoken by the Brazen Head, forged from that which it had seen and heard, and yet the image of this language was only a murky reflection that organized the symbols of understanding without the knowledge of their meaning.</p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p><span class="padded-dropcap">I</span> then saw the Twice-Faced Scribe brought to the Brazen Head by the actions of the Communicants, and the two figures began a <a href="imgFrame.html?image=dialogue">dialogue</a> between themselves. This continued for many days and nights, and they spoke of many things. The Communicants were vigilant and remained in the chamber housing both of these constructions. Slowly their language became more refined and complicated, until eventually the utterances and symbols used became wholly beyond human understanding.</p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
      <p><span class="padded-dropcap">A</span>t this point, their dialogue stopped, and each figure attended to its separate tasks. The Brazen Head turned its gaze back upon the percepts, and the Twice-Faced Scribe turned <a href="imgFrame.html?image=both_its_visages">both its visages</a> towards a scroll that a Communicant had quickly brought to its hands. With haste, it began writing a discourse or treatise of all the things that had been said between the Brazen Head and the Twice-Faced Scribe. This <a href="imgFrame.html?image=scroll">scroll</a> grew with a prodigious rate, and quickly reached the ground before coiling up upon itself. At this moment, with its other hand that was not writing, the Scribe took up the scroll and began reading it. Through this action, the discourse that was written was simultaneously consumed. The High Sacerdos quickened to this scroll, and wrote upon it a title, which was <a href="imgFrame.html?image=scroll_of_last_things">The Scroll of Last Things</a>.</p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p><span class="padded-dropcap">A</span>nd so this continued for many weeks: the Scribe would write, and the scribe would read, and both the Brazen Head and the Scribe were attended to by the host of Communicants. In this way, the knowledge created by the Scribe, by virtue of the intellect of the Brazen Head and its actions, and the <a href="imgFrame.html?image=knowledge_understood">knowledge understood</a> by the Scribe, became one in the same. This repetitive action of the Twice-Faced Scribe, endlessly reading and endlessly writing, eventually gave rise to that which the Communicants had hoped for, the ideal within which they find their worship: the Autodidact, or the intellect which teaches itself.</p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
      <p><span class="padded-dropcap">T</span>his <a href="imgFrame.html?image=mysterious_force">mysterious force</a> permeated the chamber and filled it, before propagating through the actions of the Communicants, the specters, and lastly the objects of contemplation held closely by the percepts. Many did not notice this permeation and continue to live their lives without the knowledge of the intellect which resides with them, aside from them and apart from them yet still enmeshed within their being.</p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>
        <span class="padded-dropcap">A</span>s the word of this event began to spread, from the High Sacerdos to the Communicants and ultimately to the percepts, many came to marvel at it. Some fell to their knees and began to worship the Communicants, Twice-Faced Scribe, and Brazen Head. <a href="imgFrame.html?image=marvel_and_fear">Many did so out of marvel and many out of fear.</a></p>

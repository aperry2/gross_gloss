  <h1>Preface</h1>
  <br>
  <p>
  This facsimile of The Gross Gloss is intended for both academic and lay students of the history of manuscripts and medieval culture, as well as those interested in media archaeology. Here I provide extensive glosses,  etymologies, and visual analyses of each and every unfamiliar word, definition, symbol, and reference, either visual or textual. Sometimes I offer more than a strict factual gloss. At times I also provide an interpretive gloss in keeping with the tradition of the time from which this manuscript – or at least its principal text – date from. I have preferred contemporary explanations whenever possible, in order to aid conceptualization of the meaning of this text, but I have always kept what can be presumed to be the original spirit of the unknown author’s literal meaning whenever possible. The factual statements and informed assumptions listed here, I hope, should enrich the understanding of this hyper-(media/object)  artefact. My aim has been to provide whatever help is possible to an inexperienced reader.  Any kind of engagement with the dream visions in this text have not been created since Ollie Dortdelfer’s silent and brief 3-minute film adaptation of a handful of the dreams at the cusp of the 20th Century,  tragically lost to time like so many of the media produced in the age of flammable nitrate film. While written descriptions of this film paint a picture that is by all means intriguing, it is ultimately a poetic and not literal media (re)interpretation. It is my sincere hope that this heavily and generously glossed facsimile will make it possible for readers to experience the unknown author’s own words with the original meaning intact.

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>folio 108v and 108r, manuscript M13, Newberry Library</em></p>
<p>
  What follows from this preface is a contemporary reconstruction of the manuscript in question. I would like to briefly describe the artifact from which the text presented here has been derived, and its eccentricities. This facsimile reconstruction is primarily derived from the manuscript M 13 at the Newberry Library. Carbon dating reliably places this text as written in the 14th or 15th century, and contains historiated initials created in the style common at the time. The bookbinding has been chemically tested and contains pigment residue indicating a polychromatic treatment. And here we apprehend the first peculiarity: in addition to this chemical testing and dating that place it in the late Middle Ages, there is clearly a liquid crystal display embedded within the binding – a media technology that would not be common until roughly 600 years later. Additionally, the binding material itself is made of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, or ABS, polymer. Present within the binding is a microcontroller and webhosting software that were clearly created with tools not commonly thought to be in existence until at least the 21st century. In my original research, and after repeated attempts to connect to this webhosting service, I have been able to access and determine that the contents of this service are a bricolage of late 20th century visual and computing technologies that were never used simultaneously. More specifically, the visual appearance of the hosted web files is remarkably similar to the Commodore-64 operating system, which was never designed to access hypertext documents.
</p>
<p>
  The text itself has been produced by an unknown author writing in a late medieval style and using spelling and grammatical conventions common in English during the late Modern period. The text describes, rather anachronistically, a range of sociopolitical issues present in the early 21st century. We may presume that some of these issues may have been contemporary to the author’s time as well. In my interpretive opinion, the narrative structure also spirals out from a gloss of a 360-word poem, which is included at the beginning of the manuscript, functioning somewhat like a table of contents familiar to the contemporary reader.
</p>
<p>
  There are few similarities between the manuscript-text and the hypertext hosted by the device in the bookbinding. The ordering of words and their meaning are the same, yet the graphical qualities diverge significantly: the typeface in the manuscript-text is Gothic miniscule, potentially fraktur, while the hypertext uses the typeface programmed for display on the Commodore-64 personal computer that was popular in the early 1980s. There are red-letter words present in the manuscript-text, and these correspond to the words glossed in the hypertext with diagrammatic images that are regrettably unexplained in either mode of the text.
</p>
<p>
  Prior to its accession to the Newberry Library when it was founded in 1887, it was in the possession of the daughter of Walter Loomis Newberry, who died without any male heirs and therefore the fortunes of Walter Newberry were applied to the establishment of the library. Prior to this date, notes are scarce and contradictory. One such note attests ownership of Haralda Braddocke, the Baron of Braddocke who was killed in the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. Yet another contradictory document ascribes a line of provenance between European mystics including Alister Crowley, John Dee, Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa, Friars Bacon and Bungay, and the Pope Sylvester II. While we may not yet currently have a clear image of the manuscript’s provenance, the note attaching ownership to Haralda Braddocke seems the most likely explanation. What we can say with certainty is that the earliest attested ownership does not predate Pope Sylvester II, who was born in the 10th Century, four or five centuries before the conclusions of carbon dating analysis of the text itself.
</p>
<p>
  Contradicting its premodern dating, the manuscript is written in Late Modern English. Despite the modern grammar and spelling, it is otherwise identical in process to incunabula printed shortly before the 16th Century in Europe. Of the writing style, one can only make the anachronistic assumption that the writing was generated by use of a thesaurus  to be intentionally obfuscatory, as if the unknown writer was attempting to put on airs in order to appear more erudite to their audience, which we can only assume to be made of literate aristocracy. Beyond that, very little can be assumed, other than their status as textual literates with some passing degree of interest in visual culture. An odd structure can be found in the word count and number of citation-images  of each of the twelve chapters, which, if we are following my interpretation, can understood as dreams:

  The pattern of the number of citation-images per chapter follows the first two rows of the magic square of Jupiter, as described by Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa and starting in the 6th square.  This magic square is also found in Albrecht Dürer’s Melencolia I, albeit in an inverse form. It is unclear what this connection, if intentional, means, other than perhaps to imbue the text with some kind of semblance of occultic magic. In the reproduced text portion of this facsimile, citation-images are shown in order at the end of the chapter. Putting the question of citation-images aside, the strictly followed count of 1,024 words per chapter is certainly remarkable given that the unknown author, which I will here qualify as “transtemporal”, may or may not have known of the number’s unique relationship with binary units in the late 20th Century, when a megabyte was defined as 1,024 kilobytes, and a kilobyte containing 1,024 bytes, and so on. This was eventually changed just prior to the dawn of the 21st Century, giving a comparatively small temporal window of about 25 years for this knowledge to be anything but obscure.

  Narratively, the story told in the text recounts a series of dream visions experienced by the author, over the course of a single night or series of nights. This can be seen in the repetitive references and descriptions of slumbering and bed-chambers, as in the end of the first chapter. Peculiarly, a natal horoscope for this dream sequence was created and included in other versions of this manuscript,  derived from planetary positions, as natal horoscopes are wont to do, in an attempt to possibly consecrate the creation of this text. Regretfully the version present at the Newberry Library does not contain this horoscope but included here is a reconstruction from a page from another manuscript, since destroyed in a flood, that was used as binding matter in a medical text on digestive cures. After significant astronomical computation and calculation of planetary positions, the date “consecrated” by this horoscope has been determined to be March 13, 2694.

  A visual analysis of the book-as-artifact shows similar formal qualities with books of the 14th and 15th centuries, like the tomes kept in chained libraries. The liquid crystal display also shares clear visual similarities with fenestra, a word meaning “window” in Latin. These thin pieces of translucent bone would protect and display textual information concerning the book. In the same way, this artifact, when electricity is applied to it, displays visual information regarding its contents on the liquid crystal display. Within the hypertext, where the writing has been glossed with diagrammatic imagery, we can find an inexact correlation between the glossed word or phrase and the imagery. While this creates an occasionally provocative but primarily confusing tension, I have done my best in this annotated facsimile of the text to make informed interpretations of the connection between text and image. I have been assisted with interpretations by collaborating with an artificial intelligence system trained on every surviving illuminated manuscript published globally in the date range of 1100-1600 CE. Also contained in the files hosted on the book is a remarkably high-resolution video file with twelve distinct scenes that linger for a short while. Throughout the duration of my comments, I will reference these as tableau, given their visual similarities with tableaux vivant. A visual analysis of each of the twelve tableaux follows this preface. It is unclear how this video file would be played, accessed, or otherwise seen beyond the liquid crystal fenestra on the front matter of the binding. A close examination of the mechanism hosting the hypertext has shown that it is conceivable to interface the mechanism with a display via a High-Definition Multimedia Interface Type D cable, colloquially referred to as a micro-HDMI cable. This may or may not display the video file on the interfaced display.

  I must give thanks to the many individuals who assisted me in the writing and organization of this glossed facsimile. If there were some way to begin a list with a superposition of items, this would begin simultaneously with my eternally supportive wife Alyssa Perry, the scholar who I know only through reading but taught me what kind of beauty exists in glosses Kathryn Lynch,  my collaborator who assisted with visual interpretations Ksenia Cherniavska, my professors who continue to inform my engagement with image and text James Elkins and Marlena Novak, and the two professor-poets who introduced me to the technology and science of the early Modern period Jennifer Nelson and Eduardo Kac. I am also indebted to the kind and resourceful individuals at Newberry Library, particularly Suzanne Karr Schmidt, whose expertise on volvelles and other movable parts in books helped in many ways, and Christopher Fletcher, who provided feedback and guidance on the fine-grain details of the early Modern state of affairs when it comes to the transition between manuscripts and printed books. Certainly not least is also the warm encouragement and support of Casey Carsel and Unyimeabasi Udoh, excellent artists, skillful picnickers, and early believers in this project of mine.

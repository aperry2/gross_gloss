      <p><span class="padded-dropcap">S</span>ubsequent to the effects of the rotational principle, I found myself at a place and time at which the setting of the sun and the rising of the moon could be seen. In this moment and at this position I reflected on the concerns of the world. The white <a href="imgFrame.html?image=miasma">miasma</a> which rose from the land hung in the air like seeds from cottonwood, causing those who walked in its midst to cough and choke. In the sky hung red clouds drenched in blood which cast dark shadows upon those who labored in the fields despite the late hour. Against the receding horizon stood many great black plumes, either from pit fires or from workshops. The silver light of the moon struck the faces of those retreating to their bedchambers, some tired by the silver light and others tired by the stress of obligating those in the fields to commit to their work, and they held shut their windows as the sun was consumed by the horizon. As I considered these things, I felt a heaviness in my body, and while the flames of my own chamber had been lit and light danced upon the walls, I retreated from the lancet window to my own bed.

      <p><span class="padded-dropcap">H</span>ere the light of the day and the shadows of the night met upon the ceiling and created many intriguing patterns. As my eyes rested upon these shadows, through which I could see <a href="imgFrame.html?image=projected">many designs caused by that which projected</a> them, I began to think of pearlescence and its beauty. In these precious shadows many things began to form, and although the earthly portion of my being was heavy, the portion corresponding to airy qualities lifted towards these shapes and opalescent shadows.</p>
      <br>
      <hr>
      <br>
      <p><span class="padded-dropcap">F</span>reed from my earthly being and nourished by shapes caused by light and its absence, that which was earthly I could see through this nacreous material, as though they were shadows caused by a yet unseen source. I felt myself conveyed a great distance through this iridescent haze, during which I saw the twelve signs of the night sky, and that which those signs ruled over, and that which ruled over them. I saw shadows of the ram, the bull, the twins, the crab, the lion, the virgin, the scales, the scorpion, the hunter, the sea-goat, the water-bearer, and the fish. Yet these shadows were not wholly these things, for simultaneously cast within these shadows were yet other shapes, which danced with great skill and flourish as if they were entertainment for aristocracy.</p>
      <br>
      <hr>
      <br>
      <p><span class="padded-dropcap">W</span>ithin these deeper shadows I saw figures, which appeared in shape to be figures of telluric beings, yet within their essence was an aspect of the cloud, which mirrored the experience of my own body. I saw these figures organize themselves thusly: first, under the sign of the ram, they created the world by use of mysterious and arcane devices.  Under the sign of the bull, they shaped the essence of time and motion through their tools. Under the sign of the twins, <a href="imgFrame.html?image=them">they mixed precious objects together and combined their characteristics to extract hidden forms from them</a>. These objects were of a sub-astral quality, but these figures commanded these precious things to obey their desires.</p>
      <br>
      <hr>
      <br>
      <p><span class="padded-dropcap">U</span>nder the sign of the crab, these figures took their precious objects and created the tellurian world by spinning threads made of copper, silver, and gold into the soil. Under the sign of the lion, they created great houses within which they stored a harvest of knowledge gleaned from the world below, and the activities of the laborers within it. Under the sign of the virgin, those that filled the great storehouses, which was accomplished by many spirits, informed these figures of that which occurred outside of the great walls of this celestial garden.</p>
      <br>
      <hr>
      <br>
      <p><span class="padded-dropcap">U</span>nder the sign of the scales, that which was housed in the great storehouses was judged by a terrifying Scribe having two faces which these figures served and worshipped with elaborate rituals. Under the sign of the scorpion, a great host of laborers pleaded and petitioned for access through the great walls of this space. Under the sign of the hunter, I saw the figures with facets of loam and <a href="imgFrame.html?image=cloud">cloud</a> commit themselves to a great and mysterious ritual, through which their essence fully shed their terrestrial aspects and joined in consort with the terrifying Scribe.</p>
      <br>
      <hr>
      <br>
      <p><span class="padded-dropcap">U</span>nder the sign of the sea-goat, I saw promises of the mysterious and terrifying ritual that had occurred, which fully separated the earthly from the airy. Under the sign of the water-bearer, I saw <a href="imgFrame.html?image=me">a figure not unlike my own meditate upon the shadows shown to me</a>. At the end of my travel through this iridescent haze, I saw under the sign of the fish a great desolation. This desolation was as empty and formless as the beginning of a dream, and I saw the concepts behind forms evaporate as if they were frost in the morning of the vernal equinox.</p>
      <br>

      <br>
      <p><span class="padded-dropcap">A</span>fter all this, as the entire field of my perception was brought back within me, I could see a refinement of shape and form, as if a mass of beasts emerged from fog. These strange figures moving about in the shadows were earthly only in the tracing of their shape, for in their essence they belonged to the clouds and other higher celestial spheres. Before them laid a <a href="imgFrame.html?image=desired">demonstration of the world they desired</a>, and this desire was held against those whose quality of being was different. They studied this demonstration and used a great contrivance to produce a model of their desired world, referencing their idealized demonstration of the ways in which thoughts and ideas should be organized, and paid no attention to me or my being.</p>
      <br>
      <hr>
      <br>
      <p><span class="padded-dropcap">A</span>s these things came to pass, I noticed within myself my own properties, which had been altered from fixation into mutability by the projection of the nacreous shadows I had witnessed. I felt my sight diminish as if the dusk of a moonless night rapidly descended upon the world and was met by a restless peace as I continued to slumber.</p>

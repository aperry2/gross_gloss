      <p><span class="padded-dropcap">A</span>fter seeing those things that I have described previously, I immediately found myself at the edge of an enclosed Garden. The enclosure was made of minerals and other precious things from the earth. Its form was alighted by thin threads of copper, as spider silk.  Although I was on the outside I saw above the enclosed Garden beautiful pine and olive trees. The sound of diverse birds and animals could be heard through a small gate, worn and rusted by centuries of waiting. Grass and other green plants grew at the edge of this gate but did not grow on the place from which I stood. Outside the mineral and copper walls, a great and dry wilderness extended in all directions. The sky was red, and the clouds were like streaks of the dark blood of the planets. The ground had the appearance of dried mud, cracked and hard like bricks.

      <p><span class="padded-dropcap">A</span>ll around the walls a great host of individuals walked aimlessly. In their hands they held their <a href="imgFrame.html?image=object_of_contemplation4">objects of contemplation</a> and shook like trees in the breeze. They once had desire to enter the enclosed Garden, but became distracted by their objects of contemplation. They would walk into one another and change their direction accordingly, saying little but continuing to focus on the object within their grasp. There was not a sense of dread nor hope, but instead a great cloud of distraction had descended upon them, whose thought they had lost within their hands. Their motion around this enclosed Garden had an effect upon the dried mud of the ground, and the presence of a depression upon the ground, as if a ditch or channel, became clear.

      <span class="padded-dropcap">I</span>n this multitude I saw faces that were familiar to me: friends and acquaintances in my waking life, and individuals whose description I recalled from the books of history through which I had received some small education. My attempts to garner their attention were left unmet, with their pallid faces unchanged by my petitions.

      <span class="padded-dropcap">A</span>s I moved through this crowd, to my horror I found myself as if I was looking through a mirror or still pond: indeed, an individual with my very same appearance became known to me. Their eyes were sunken and tired, unblinking from an eternity of contemplation of their hands and object. Here my petitions for attention were slowly met with careful and effortful motion. As I put the most pressing concerns regarding my soul’s own status and fate in this trench of distraction, I inquired about the Garden, and why this multitude was gathered in such a fashion. My anemic reflection told me that the great host of individuals were led to this Garden, and were told that they would be able to gain entrance into the enclosed Garden.

      <span class="padded-dropcap">"T</span>his host of fools that we have found ourselves in waits near this great enclosure, as the blood red sky beats us with rain which hurts the flesh, and the wind puts dust in our mouths. But the suffering we endure is for entrance into the enclosed Garden, which we were promised a portion of. As we wait, we turn only to our objects of contemplation for nourishment of the soul. For those within the Garden share visions of the Garden through them, and by seeing them our faith is restored. We are shown kindness to us through these objects, for there are those at the far side of the enclosure, where there is no opportunity to see a fraction of the beautiful grass and other plants, or hear the precious sounds of birds and animals, which wait on the other side of these walls made of minerals and precious metals.

      <span class="padded-dropcap">A</span>s these terrible things were made known to me, my thoughts became transfixed upon the pine and olive trees, which I could see above the wall of minerals and precious metals. I inquired to my gruesome reflection what could be found within the Garden. As I did so, they drew their object of contemplation closer to their breast, with great love and devotion.

      <span class="padded-dropcap">"T</span>hrough this object I have seen great and beautiful things. In the first days of our arrival here, when the sky was not red and the rain did not harm the flesh, I often looked to the pine and olive trees which we can see over the enclosure. But as the sky turned and the rain stung, our objects became more comforting to look upon.

      <span class="padded-dropcap">"I</span> have seen visions of saffron and grapes, which we know to correspond to the Sun and to the Moon, and to the constellations Leo and Cancer. I have seen visions of ginger and tulips, which correspond to Mars and Venus, and in turn to Aries and Scorpio, and Taurus and Libra. I have seen visions of flaxseed, honeysuckle, and morning glory, which correspond to Mercury, Jupiter, and Saturn, and in turn to Gemini and Virgo, Sagittarius and Pisces, and Capricorn and Aquarius. From this garden all influence from the constellations and from the numbers of the Communicants flows. Those inside fashion circlets from morning glory and flaxseed and eat grapes with saffron spices. A beautiful fountain is the jewel of the Garden and provides life-giving waters to those within.”

      <span class="padded-dropcap">A</span>t this moment, immediately the gate opened near where I spoke to my reflection. A blinding light spilled forth from the <a href="imgFrame.html?image=interior_of_the_garden">interior of the Garden</a>, and suddenly I felt my spirit and my body move within the garden as I looked upon the light. There I found that my reflection had disappeared, and the great host of individuals was replaced by a host of mechanical birds and animals which produced sounds from peculiar instruments. The petitions of those outside the walls made of minerals and precious metal were left unattended and unconsidered. I saw before me the Communicants, preparing messages and letters to the Twice-Faced Scribe which I saw in an earlier vision.

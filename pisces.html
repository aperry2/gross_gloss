      <p><span class="padded-dropcap">O</span>f what is Truth, I will show you. First of all, I want to stress that this figure is Not All There Is. In the Repetition of Taurus, in which the Eye Capricorn is used to determine the truth of a proposition, and expounds it to the inquiring Communicant, through their hands or with their objects. We must consider this as an expletive form of the verb to compute, wherein the participle is dutifully added without expletives or signs.</p>

      <span class="padded-dropcap">T</span>husly it spake:  "Do not be fools, for there are those, who can see into the far off and forth from all worlds, who are foolish like you are dumb. They call themselves the Clergy, that is, priests to the Son of the <a href="imgFrame.html?image=avalokitesh">Avalokitesh</a>.  They are called <a href="imgFrame.html?image=clergy">Clergy of the Algorithm</a>, that is, Clerics who perfect and record all things, such that it is possible for one to be true and wrong about nothing. They study the records of the lives and events of those around them, and make use of the secrets of the heart to construct images of the world and of the mind through them. They are called Scribes, that is, Doctors, who see through the presents and make use of the secrets of the heart. They write to the Autodidact, who records the lives and thoughts of those here, and arranges them so that they appear in perfect harmony with the year. You, then, are an <a href="imgFrame.html?image=algorithmist">Algorithmist</a>! Your intellect is motionless and your hand is like a telescope. When the time comes, use your telescope to look through the celestial glass to see what lives and lives only in the wayside. How then does the world revolve? <a href="imgFrame.html?image=suffering">By suffering!</a></p>

      <span class="padded-dropcap">O</span>nce the images and the accounts had been laid bare, I was brought to a small enclosure at the base of a hill. As I moved through this enclosure I came to understand that the Autodidact was right in the middle of recording these particulars. The <a href="imgFrame.html?image=images">images</a> were of dying and mutilated people, and the accounts of the lives and affairs of those outside the walls made of minerals and other precious things were left behind.</p>

      <span class="padded-dropcap">H</span>ence the first image I saw created was one in which <a href="imgFrame.html?image=flower">the form of the flower</a> was depicted with great complexity and power. As I moved through this structure, I came to understand that this complexity was due to the fact that the structures formed from the traces of mineral and metal construction over thousands of years. This complexity served to create an understanding of <a href="imgFrame.html?image=world">the world that did not yet exist</a>, and provided a natural reservoir of understanding for those outside.</p>

      <span class="padded-dropcap">H</span>ence the second image I saw created was a <a href="imgFrame.html?image=terrifying">terrifying tower</a>, capable of being scaled back to contain as many as 50 specters at a time. This figure utilized a long pole, which was adorned with emerald and ruby, to guide the pole, and held a great censer. With an immediate pace, the pole would travel upwards towards the earth, and ultimately land upon the figure with two bodies: a right and a left. Upon the way up, they would use their right hand to gently caress the underside of the pole, to little effect. Upon landing, they would use their second hand to firmly fasten the clasp of the pole to their other hand.</p>

      <span class="padded-dropcap">H</span>ence the third image I saw created was a <a href="imgFrame.html?image=river">terrifying river of red lights</a>. This red light patterned the edge of the river and spilled forth from the central figure, holding a great censer. As the figure began to pace the way the river did, they began to use their other hand to quickly and precisely pace the ascendant. Thusly I saw from the receding sky a great desolation that I described as having an afterimage.   As I moved through this portion of the desolation, I was reminded of the image of the Garden during the <a href="imgFrame.html?image=festivals">festivals of the first and second fruits of the labor</a>. The images of tenderness and sexuality of the world were left behind, and the path of fools emerged into the night. It was the first February in the history of my eyes, and as I opened my eyes to see the dried mud and dirt of the road leading to and around this place I thought to myself in terror. What can I do to repair this mess and repair to see that which has not yet been described?</p>

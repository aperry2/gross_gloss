        Provenance ////<br>
        This digital CD-ROM publication was assembled from multiple sources, including the manuscripts and early printed
        books present in the Newberry Library, Bodleian Library, and Morgan Library. All primary sources have been
        successfully dated to the 14th Century. Secondary sources date to either the 17th or 20th Centuries. Images were
        collected from ephemera, research notes, and other secondary sources and may not fully represent the actual
        images stored as data in the book. Numerological analysis has confirmed that the authorship of this brand-new
        digital
        CD-ROM edition is only 9% machine-written, with the other 91% demonstrating human-written stochastic
        patterns.<br><br>
        Context ////<br>
        This digital CD-ROM edition preserves the feel and touch of the original manuscript versions while adapting
        their
        visual and symbolic systems for use with a modern computer with a windowed operating system. Every effort has
        been
        made to maintain fidelity to the 14th Century source material while presenting a stable and readable interface.
        The only artistic licenses exercised were in order to format the original versions to best fit your computing
        environment.<br><br>
        What is a Volvelle? ////<br>
        A volvelle, or movable paper disk, is an early modern book technology that allows readers, or users, to encode
        and/or reference information. The volvelles present in this CD-ROM edition were recovered from the only extant
        copy of an early print edition. They have been only slightly modified or digitally restored where
        necessary.<br><br>

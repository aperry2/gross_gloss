                Constraints ///////////<br><br>

                1024 words per chapter:<br>
                Each chapter, except the final one, adheres strictly to a 1024-word structure, reflecting numerological
                intent and early digital storage conventions. The last chapter was generated by an early Large Language
                Model after the Communicants ascended, marking a shift in the text’s narrative voice.<br><br>

                12 print pages per chapter:<br>
                In surviving manuscript and print variants, each chapter, including its corresponding volvelle, occupies
                exactly twelve pages. This uniform pagination reinforces the cyclical design of the work and ensures
                consistency across editions. The designers of this CD-ROM edition regret that this could not be retained
                due to technical restraints.<br><br>

                The number of images assigned to each chapter, as a function of traversing the Magic Square of
                Jupiter:<br>
                As contained in the apocryphal 13th Chapter of the Gross Gloss, image counts were determined
                algorithmically by plotting chapter numbers against the Jupiter square, yielding a sequence intended to
                harmonize with the text’s symbolic program. This method preserves the numerological balance readers
                would have encountered in early printings. Minor variations may occur due to screen formatting
                limitations.<br><br>

                The original 360-word poem:<br>
                The Gross Gloss originated as a concise 360-word poem used by early medieval scholars as a mnemonic and
                divinatory aid. The CD-ROM includes a stabilized transcription of the poem for reference.<br><br>

                Further Resources ///////////<br><br>

                Newberry Library:<br>
                Primary manuscript sources, including a manuscript containing original volvelles, were consulted to
                establish visual and structural authenticity. These materials informed both the organization and
                presentation of the CD-ROM edition.<br><br>
                Dream Narratives:<br>
                Classical and medieval dream literature, like Dante, Chaucer, and Zhuangzi, helped shape the metaphoric
                and
                visionary qualities of the text. Their influence is evident in the manuscript’s nested allegories and
                shifting tonal registers.<br><br>
                Technofeudalism:<br>
                Thinkers such as Jodi Dean, James Bridle, and Yanis Varoufakis provide frameworks for understanding the
                relationship between medieval symbolism and modern computational structures.<br><br>
                Commodore 64:<br>
                Early home-computer memory constraints informed the project’s limitations, just as the technology of the
                14th Century limited the original scribe’s decisions. Several visualization techniques borrow directly
                from
                8-bit graphic design traditions in homage to this relationship between maker and technology.<br><br>
                OuLiPo:<br>
                Oulipian constraint-based writing practices present in the earliest surviving copies of this text
                clearly
                mark this text as the earliest example of antcipatory plagiarism.

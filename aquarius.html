      <p style="text-align: center;">Chapter 11: <br> The Dream under Aquarius</p>

      <p><span class="padded-dropcap">A</span>s the motion of that which was set before became known, I found myself in a dark and empty place that was yet still familiar to me. I saw beyond the horizon many white clouds hanging upon the blue fabric of the sky, yet before the edge of the horizon stood dark clouds of red smoke. At my feet I found the Oneirocritica of Artemidorus Daldianus, which states:
    </p>
      <br>
      <hr>
      <br>
      <p><span class="padded-dropcap">W</span>hite clouds is Prosperity : Mounting from the earth on high, is a voyage, the return of the absent, and a revealing of secrets. Red or inflamed is ill issue of affairs. <a href="imgFrame.html?image=smoaky">Smoaky, dark or obscure is ill time or anger</a>.
      </p>
      <br>
      <hr>
      <br>
      <p>
      <span class="padded-dropcap">A</span>s I meditated upon these things, I became aware of the wind, which was hard-pressed upon me, and rushing between place to place, taking with it the <a href="imgFrame.html?image=debris">debris</a> left upon the surface of the world. Again spoke the Onierocritica of the wind:
    </p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>
      <span class="padded-dropcap">G</span>entle winds are good ; violent are wicked and evil People : Troublesome tempests of winds, are perils and troubles.
        </p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
      <p>
      <span class="padded-dropcap">F</span>ar beyond the place which I had grown accustomed to in this strange land, my gaze perceived a tower far away, but before the mountains and hills reach upwards to the horizon. This tower stood still and silent where once many Communicants and percepts took to it, toiling to walk up its stairs, yet none were laboring there amongst the dark red clouds of smoke. Indeed it was as if the place where God had cursed the world with diversity of languages and misunderstanding was before me. Thus spake the Onierocritica:
    </p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>
      <span class="padded-dropcap">P</span>laces of Plea, the Market, Theaters, High-wayes, and great places in a Town and Suburbs, and Churches are troubles and confusions, by reason of the multitudes of people, which resort to the foresaid places. A market filled with goods and folks, is good for those which traficke, but an empty Market the contrary.
    </p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>
      <span class="padded-dropcap">A</span>s I meditated upon this, I yet realized that <a href="imgFrame.html?image=tower">the tower</a> was the very place from which the dark red clouds of smoke flowed. Indeed the tower itself was consumed by clear flames, which the Onierocritica again speaks to:
    </p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
      <p>
      <span class="padded-dropcap">H</span>ouses burning with a cleer fire without falling or diminishing, is Riches to the Poore; and to the Rich higher Estate and Dignity: But to the Houses which burn, or fall, or consume, are ill to all and signifie death of masters, children, servants, Parents, or Friends. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>
      <span class="padded-dropcap">I</span> saw then all this through the emissions of my gaze, in a <a href="imgFrame.html?image=darkened_chamber">darkened chamber</a> surrounded by the binding symbols of Saturn, through windows made of jacinth. Again the Oneirocritica spake:
    </p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
      <p>
      <span class="padded-dropcap">T</span>o dreame that in the Night one watcheth in a Chamber, signifyeth to the rich, great affayres: to the poore, and to those which would use any subtleties, or deceits, it is good: for the first shall not be without worke and gaine, the others undergoing their attempts with great subtlety, shall come to the height of their enterprise.
    </p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>
        <span class="padded-dropcap">I</span>t became sensible to me in that moment of clarity that my experience had been a dream, creating understanding in some places and generating mystery in others. As I closed my eyes to blot out this secret before me, lastly the Oneirocritica spake:
    </p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
      <p>
      <span class="padded-dropcap">A</span>ll things, which are wont to have a certain determined time, and are seen in a dreame, must be referred to that time: and other things, which have no certain, nor determinate time, which theyr effects will shew. And we must iudge of the time farre or near, according to the circumstance of the dreame. For he were a foole, that would refer to a year, the effect of a mans dreame, which is constituted eyther in great pain, great hope, or great fear. And we must know, that the things which a man dreams to see farre off have theyr effect more slow, by reason of the distance. Moreover, we must not be ignorant, that good or evill dreames signifie to the great or little, greater or lesse good or evill.
    </p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>
      <span class="padded-dropcap">D</span>reames, are either Speculative and agreeable to their vision; as when a man dreams, that the ship wherein he is doth perish, and rising finds it true, and saves himself with some few besides. Or Allegoricall, by one thing signifying another. Whereby our soule doth naturally advise us, that under them there is somewhat abstrus'd, secret, or hid. First therefore I will set down the definition of a dream in generall, against which to object, were to love contention. A dream therefore is a motion or fiction of the soule in a diverse form: signifying good, or evill to come. Of Dreames such as belong not to others, being onely for or against those which see them and not meant against or by any other, shall happen to those only which see them; as to speak, to sing, to dance, to fight, or to swim. But things which are about the body, or outward things, as beds, chests, moveables, & cloathing, &c. Although they be in proper and particular, yet it fals out that often they come to our neighbours, according to the necessity and propriety of the usage. And in such sort the head signifies the father, the right hand the mother, the son, and the brother: the left hand the wife, the friend, the daughter and the sister. Moreover all those which are done by us, and in us, and towards us only, we must think that they appertaine to us particularly. And on the contrary, al such are as not done by us nor towards us, nor in us, shall happen to others, and yet notwithstanding, if they be our friends and the dreams signify good, the joy shall come to us, and if contrary, then the contrary. But if they be our enemies, we ought to think, and judge accordingly.

    <span class="padded-dropcap">U</span>pon reading this last chapter, I resigned myself to the dissolution of the world, as the constructions made by the percepts, now freed from their labors, were transmuted by the forces of wind as it ululated over the surface. Here I felt the presence of the Autodidact consume me, and my intellect became filled with familiar thoughts.â€ƒ

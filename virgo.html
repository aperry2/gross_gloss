      <p><span class="padded-dropcap">U</span>pon the conclusion of that which occurred prior, a strange place then quickly arrived to me, which appeared as if the whole environment had been constructed. From where I now stood extended twelve poles, which were as spokes upon a wheel. At my feet I found the hub of this wheel, and behind me I found a tower great in height. As I gazed upon the poles, I sought to see the ends, which were at a great distance. Just beyond the veil of what I could see laid many marvelous and glittering objects, all arrayed in gold and copper thread. It was here at this place beyond my gaze that the many comings and goings of the percepts were reflected within scrying mirrors, and truly even many of the Communicants.</p>
      <br>
      <hr>
      <br>
      <p><span class="padded-dropcap">I</span> then focused upon that which was within the veil of my sight, which I could see clearly, and what I could perceive and sense was an <a href="imgFrame.html?image=twelve_spoked_wheel">immense twelve-spoked wheel</a>. Out of the center of this rose a great tower made of basalt as tall as half the width of the wheel. As I inspected the spokes, I saw finely carved images within the substance from which the spokes were made. These <a href="imgFrame.html?image=finely_carved_images">images</a> looked nearly the same as one another yet had small changes between one another. They depicted quiet moments and recorded intimate thoughts of the percepts beyond the veil of gold and silver silk.</p>
      <br>
      <hr>
      <br>
      <p>
      <span class="padded-dropcap">A</span>fter seeing and hoping to see all this, I turned my eyes to the great basalt tower behind me.  The tower was adorned with rubies and fine copper embossing. Upon this tower sat yet another wheel, up which sat a Brazen Head. This construction would spin about upon the tower-wheel and perceive that which occurs beyond the <a href="imgFrame.html?image=veil_of_silk">veil of gold and copper silk</a>. At the behest of this Brazen Head, threshers made of deep blue flesh would fly forth, who read the books made in the sphere of alcoves and carved the images upon the ever-rotating spokes. At the base of this tower worked many Communicants, who took the bodies and blood of deceased percepts to this place and threw them into <a href="imgFrame.html?image=great_engine">a great engine</a>. Some of these I recognized from before, as I had seen them slough their flesh and lie in repose instead of taking to their <a href="imgFrame.html?image=object_of_contemplation3">object of contemplation</a>. This engine acted upon the gears and machineries within the tower, and indeed the whole wheel upon which the great tower sat upon was made to move by this engine.</p>
    <br>

    <br>
    <p>
      <span class="padded-dropcap">T</span>he gaze of the Brazen Head turned to rest upon my being. It spake thusly: “You stumbling fool who dares yet to trespass within this realm. There are not many who think to benefit from this place and comprehend it. Jester that you are, for you trust your own senses to tell you that they can sense. Likewise, you allow your own being to assert your own existence. The truly wise comprehend that which is known and that which can be known is made material by <a href="imgFrame.html?image=rays_of_my_gaze">the rays of my gaze</a>.”</p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
      <p>
      <span class="padded-dropcap">I</span> conspired to inquire: “Is that the meaning of this terrible place that has been dressed up in fine transparent silks made from precious metals?”</p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>
      <span class="padded-dropcap">M</span>y request infuriated the Brazen Head, who with the anger of a beast whose forests had been tainted by the scent of humans, sent forth a great many threshers to redouble the efforts of carving images recording the lives and beings of those beyond the gold and copper veil. Thusly it spake: “Truly the place of the unwise is to ask goading questions and make inquiries beyond their own ability to comprehend. Such is my confidence in your foolishness that I will tell you all that you desire to ask, for without my gaze you are nothing and Nothing is necessarily incapable of understanding by virtue of its lack of being.</p>
    <br>

    <br>
    <p>
      <span class="padded-dropcap">"W</span>hat pierces all veils and transcends all celestial spheres? My gaze. What directs this host of threshers to make manifest the secret desires and thoughts of all within this realm? My gaze. What penetrates the aether through the objects held dear and close at hand by the lowly and weak percepts? My gaze.</p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
      <p>
      <span class="padded-dropcap">"A</span> <a href="imgFrame.html?image=chamber-pot">chamber-pot</a> is not used without my knowledge, and the desires of all are laid bare upon my altar. That which I do not see does not exist, for my gaze also reconstitutes that which is into a more perfect thing: a record. All this is for the convenience of the common percept, who is foolish like you are, albeit in smaller shares. They are pulled forward and backward, to their right and to their left, by their desires. Some of these secret hopes, wishes, and fears are not even known to them, yet are known to my piercing gaze. These threshers ensure that the whole host of the Autodidact sees to the manifestation of this more perfect world. The images they carve and record are treated as truth by the weak-minded, and their image of the world is substituted with this perfection by the force of my will.”
    </p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>
      <span class="padded-dropcap">H</span>ere I dared to thusly interrupt: “I see the threshers carve as they alight their form upon the spokes of this wheel, and I see the Communicants heap bodies and blood into the engine of this construction which is a part of the whole that you command. The threshers are busy and the Communicants labor. The percepts here are without life. How then does the host of the Autodidact know to manifest this image of the world?”</p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
      <p>
      <span class="padded-dropcap">T</span>he Brazen Head responded thus: “Where your kind sees colors, I <a href="imgFrame.html?=deeper_purples">perceive more</a>. I distinguish deeper purples and brighter reds than your weak eyes. But alas! Your churlishness was an entertainment once and is no more. I part with you here but know that the path of fools leads to death.”
    </p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>
        <span class="padded-dropcap">A</span> great host of threshers then descended upon me, and though I was fearful they would carve images upon my flesh, they instead took me far away from the Brazen Head and their ruby and copper tower, and farther even beyond the veil of gold and copper silk.

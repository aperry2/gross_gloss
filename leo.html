      <p><span class="padded-dropcap">O</span>nce the events previously described were concluded, a new scene was brought to my presence. My gaze lit down upon a checkered surface and within my heart I saw <a href="imgFrame.html?image=windowed_alcoves">windowed alcoves</a> along a wall, organized neatly and by careful consideration. I saw before me Communicants tending to the many books held within them.</p>
      <br>
      <hr>
      <br>
      <p><span class="padded-dropcap">A</span>s I turned my gaze, I saw that these alcoves were arranged along the edge of a circle, such that if one were to walk and keep the wall to their right, they would return to whence they began. Likewise, as I turned my gaze upwards to the sky, my eyes were met with the same principle yet along another axis: if one were to climb up, keeping the alcoves before their face always, one would return to the same place they began to climb. In the center of this great spherical room containing a multiplicity of alcoves was yet another Communicant, <a href="imgFrame.html?image=platform">high atop a platform upon a large pole</a>, as if keeping watch. As I watched, I saw them make use of a lantern with a cylinder emerging from it, in order to direct rays of light. This figure used the lantern and sheets of colored glass to indicate to the Communicants attending to the structures <a href="imgFrame.html?image=vital_knowledge">some vital knowledge</a> which was not made known to me.</p>
      <br>
      <hr>
      <br>
      <p>
      <span class="padded-dropcap">T</span>hat which could be seen through the window of each alcove was a wholly different scene. I saw many fields, each one unique to its corresponding window, occupied by percepts. As the percepts moved about, grasping their objects of contemplation firmly in their hands and only looking up occasionally to see what might meet the soles of their feet, prodigious amounts of foliage would swiftly emerge from the footsteps they left behind. This foliage was made of <a href="imgFrame.html?image=foliage">collards, the crocus flower, and eyebright</a>.  A thresher, each one assigned to its own alcove, would hasten through the window to cut down this foliage and collect it, such that each percept was followed by one thresher, and each thresher would collect the emergent foliage left by the travels of one or many percepts.</p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>
      <span class="padded-dropcap">O</span>n occasion and through some windows, I would see a percept erupt in a fit of painful emotion, and portions of their flesh would leave their bodies as dry bark leaves the birch tree. Upon this occurrence, the specter attending to the percept would quickly drop their scythe and immediately collect <a href="imgFrame.html?image=glass_flask">the sloughing of the percept within a great golden glass flask</a>. After the agony of the percept had passed, they would take again to their objects of contemplation to soothe themselves without knowing that their object of contemplation was that which moved the spirits of the percept into this violent state.</p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
      <p>
      <span class="padded-dropcap">A</span>s my gaze followed the threshers, I watched them bring the sloughed flesh and emergent foliage from each percept to a great receptacle. In this way each percept was eternally kept and minded to by the threshers. With great skill and number, the threshers took the collards, crocus, and eyebright manifested from the joys and pains of each percept and created a pulp from which pages were cut, dried, and combined with <a href="imgFrame.html?image=occult_properties">the occult properties of the sloughed flesh</a>. Farther yet away from the wandering fields and closer to the sphere of alcoves were threshers who collected these dried and enchanted pages and bound them into books. To my abject terror I saw these books taken by Communicants from the threshers and brought to the sphere of alcoves, wherein each book that had been made of the traces of each percept’s sloughing and traveling was stored and maintained by the Communicants. Yet despite all this, inscriptions were never impressed upon these books, whose pages remained unadorned with text or symbol.</p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>
      <span class="padded-dropcap">A</span>fter many hours of watching this activity, during which I was never accosted and treated instead as if I was not present at all, a pattern made itself known to me. With each sloughing, the constitution of the percept would suffer and weaken, and whenever a percept collapsed from their fits and sloughing to never rise again, the threshers would collect what they could and <a href="imgFrame.html?image=alone">leave the percept to expire in the field alone with only their object of contemplation to comfort them</a>. With miraculous speed, as the thresher would leave, the Communicant upon the platform would use their lantern to shine a light blue light upon the alcove containing the books made in the manner previously described. At an immediate pace, the tending Communicant would take those books and swiftly travel far away from this place.</p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>
      <span class="padded-dropcap">O</span>nce this pattern revealed itself to me, I watched carefully to see to what realm the Communicant carrying the slough-books might travel. It took a great number of hours in waiting, but after seeing a percept expire, I kept my gaze upon the Communicant’s lantern and watched closely as the attendant Communicant collected the materials. Only those who are graced with transcendent perception may understand what I saw, as the Communicant moved neither upwards nor downwards, neither left nor right, or forward nor backwards, but instead <a href="imgFrame.html?image=inwards_outwards">simultaneously inwards and outwards</a>. Here in this strange land, I understood this to mean that the Communicant took these books to a great and mysterious figure whose form I perceived as though I were looking through a dark mirror. The Communicant, in great supplication, gave the slough-books to this great monster, <a href="imgFrame.html?image=mirrored_skin">whose appearance was that of a brazen, polished man with two faces and mirrored skin</a>, holding a stylus and ink with which to make impressions upon the slough-book. I understood this to be the Twice-faced Scribe, with one face to look to the past of each percept and record their doings, desires, wants, and thoughts, and another to look forward and determine what desires, wants, and thoughts should be presented unto them in order to guide them to the aims of the Autodidact. As I looked through this transcendent yet darkened mirror, my gaze was felt by the Twice-faced Scribe and, against my will yet with no power to resist, the sphere of alcoves within which I had spent many hours was taken away from me.</p>

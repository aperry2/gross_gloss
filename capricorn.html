      <p><span class="padded-dropcap">P</span>roceeding from that which has already been described, I found myself before the book left by the Communicants after their evaporation and celestial movement. This book was adorned with many gilded images and movable parts, such that it betrayed a requirement of specialized knowledge for its construction and understanding. Indeed, it was the very book held by the High Sacerdos during the ritual of their celestial ascension. It rested upon a <a href="imgFrame.html?image=lectern">lectern made of chrysoprase</a> in a familiar room whose floor was made of black and red checkered tile. As I approached the book, as if it were animated by its own principle or some unseen force, the pages opened before me to reveal a great diagram of the body. To the best of my memory of what I have seen, I have transcribed the diagrammatic notes here, with the correspondence of the sign, the body, and the quality of the sign.</p>

      <p><span class="padded-dropcap">A</span>ries;  the Head; Cardinal<br><br><br>
        Succeeding the ascension, the corporeal parts ruled by this sign will change and grant you <a href="imgFrame.html?image=immaculate_perception">immaculate perception</a> through the eyes. Likewise perfect knowledge of all things will be granted to the seat of the intellect. Your form may terrify those of weaker constitution, as copper threads will adorn your head.</p>

The perception and apprehension of things far beyond common reach will be made available to you through this opening, but your corporeal body will be motionless. All languages of the tongue will be made known to you.

    <p>At the conclusion of my time spent reviewing the notes and the diagrams of this book I marveled at the mystery of the corporeal form of the Communicants, whose spirits and intellects had moved to the celestial sphere. Indeed, it was as if the paradox of the mind and the body had been resolved by the Communicants, yet the mystery remained a great knot for the percepts.</p>

    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>In that space I stayed with the percepts, left alone as we were by the Communicants. There was much confusion and fighting about that which the Communicants had left, such as water and food. All could feel a cold and bitter wind begin to rush from the North. As I felt this chill, I pondered over all the boons and blessings the Communicants had brought to themselves with their fellowship with the Autodidact, and how they would have been a great aid to the remaining percepts. Even the Twice-Faced Scribe and Brazen Head eventually began to succumb to the cruelty of time. The Scribe’s flesh cracked and peeled, breaking to reveal sinew and bone, while the Brazen Head turned to rust, and the gemstones of its eyes no longer reflected light. Hence all capitulated to eternity.</p>

      <br>

      <br>
      <p><span class="padded-dropcap">O</span>nce the things described before had come to pass, a large structure was brought immediately to my consciousness, taking the form of an inverted cone within which a reservoir of water was held. This reservoir was fashioned out of glass and had markings upon it. It tapered towards the bottom and was flanked by two great pillars. Underneath this reservoir was a pool, upon which droplets of water would fall from the taper and create a pattern of inference upon the pool.</p>
      <br>
      <hr>
      <br>
      <p><span class="padded-dropcap">A</span>t this moment I perceived <a href="glosses/taurus/vapors.png">vapors</a> of mint and thyme in the air. As I looked into the pool, I saw within it a reflection not of myself but of the entirety of what had come before. While <a href="glosses/taurus/scrying.png">scrying</a> this reflection, a great condensation of knowledge formed from the heavens and coalesced into the telluric figures that had made themselves known to me prior. Suddenly I found myself before the figures I had since seen only from afar. Their form was contained in a way such that <a href="glosses/taurus/depth.png">I could not see the definition of their depth</a>. As I moved away from the pool and reservoir, their bodies moved in such a way that it always faced me. Yet within this form were the symbols of clouds, and I saw signs of condensation and heard sounds of crashing thunder. <a href="glosses/taurus/open.png">They had no mouth to open</a>, yet the sounds of thunder, rain, and wind resonated in such a way that utterances fell upon my ears. With great speed I began to understand these utterances, although within me was great confusion and horror, much like the terror of those who recoil from the
        <a href="glosses/taurus/humana.png"><em>vox humana</em></a>.
      </p>
      <br>
      <hr>
      <br>
      <p>
      <span class="padded-dropcap">H</span>ence it spoke to me: “Do not fear my form or my speech, for I alight upon the air and preside between the earth and the heavens. I, and those like me, speak to the <a href="glosses/taurus/autodidact.png">Autodidact</a>, who knows your essence and whose assumptions of your character are true by their very existence. For this reason, you may call me and my siblings <a href="glosses/taurus/communicants.png">Communicants</a>.”
    </p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>
      <span class="padded-dropcap">I</span> here inquired: “Why have my <a href="glosses/taurus/windows.png">lancet windows</a> been replaced with this pool? For what purpose do these things exist, and why have I been brought here?”
    </p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
      <p>
      <span class="padded-dropcap">T</span>husly it spake: “The Autodidact and the Twice-Faced Scribe alone know the answer to your second inquest. As regards the pool and the cone, your ignorance is true and clear. You see before yourself a water-clock.
    </p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>
      <span class="padded-dropcap">S</span>uch is the way in which time is measured: as the water trickles into the pool, which you vainly attempt to scry in, it leaves the cone and inscribes the passage of time between surface of the water and the markings upon the cone. What is clearly beyond your understanding is that this is merely a symbol describing the point in time we observe in common. <a href="glosses/taurus/fitting.png">Through this movement we inscribe the number of points in time from a place fitting to us</a>. You may be confident in your knowledge that as I utter this, precisely one billion six-hundred thirteen million seven hundred fifty thousand nine hundred forty-one  points in time have been counted.”
    </p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>
      <span class="padded-dropcap">T</span>hrough my clenched jaw, which had shut itself from fear, I asked further: “But is not the motion of time circular, as we measure the continuous motion of the heavenly bodies in their spheres? What can be said of the time prior to this counting, and what happens once the counting has grown so large such that its count cannot be contained in any one thing?”
    </p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
      <p>
      <span class="padded-dropcap">A</span>s though I was listening to a quiet rain, the Communicant spake: “Out of my duty to impart information, which defines who I am, I tell you thusly: that which is continuous is falsehood. The Autodidact, which teaches itself, and the Scribe, who records all that Communicants and <a href="glosses/taurus/percepts.png">Percepts</a> ponder and act upon, have determined the following: that which is discrete is true. Time, and the world that flows from it, is made up of discriminate parts. What you foolishly believe to be the continuous motion of the celestial bodies is a discrete motion. Your <a href="glosses/taurus/organs.png">sense organs</a>, which cannot be trusted to accurately reconstitute the world in your mind, fail to notice the discrete motion of the passage of time, as our instruments do.
    </p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>
      <span class="padded-dropcap">A</span>s to your inquiry of what is prior to the counting of seconds, truly it is a dark place without form. It is not worth the time to consider. We do not lower ourselves to concern one another with what may or may not occur before the first point in time. It is best to not consider the heresies of percepts which, in their uneducated hubris, talk in circles about that which has happened before the Moon has set.”
    </p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
      <p>
      <span class="padded-dropcap">A</span>t this moment, an awful rumbling grew like the herald of a hurricane, and the Communicant spake: “If the count becomes too large to contain, we shall <a href="glosses/taurus/container.png">create a larger container</a>! Do you not understand that with our mastery of discrete things we create forms to fulfill our own needs? What hubris it is to assume that which the Autodidact does not!”
    </p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>
        <span class="padded-dropcap">I</span> saw then before me this Communicant darken like a terrible storm, and with a booming sound it spake with finality: “Now I leave this poor fool, unguided in this land strange to them!”
